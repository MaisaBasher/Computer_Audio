User Manual
There are two modes for my Touch type project.
1. Sensor Mode:
Once the user clicks the “Lesson_With_SensorData” buDon, the lesson plan will start playing.
Users are expected to click on the leDers based on the lesson plan in order. [if the wrong key is pressed, an error sound will play. However, don’t try to recMfy it since JSON data is generated by order index, therefore pressing extra keys will make the rest of the keys wrong]
Every Mme the user presses the key (based on the lesson plan), different JSON data is loaded with body posture and finger data. And the background sound would be modified based on that. AddiMonally, different error sounds (soWer than key error) will play for the wrong finger based on JSON data.
2. The Manual Mode:
The manual mode is meant for EvaluaMon where I can control the posture sound and play the Key and finger error sound based on the user's actual performance. I made sure to choose a slow lesson plan so that I could easily track user performance.
